# A Systematic Review and Comparative Study of R Packages for Ordinal Response Regression Models

### Manuscript submited in WIREs Computational Statistics

This is the repository for the manuscript "*A Systematic Review and Comparative Study of R Packages for Ordinal Response Regression Models*" that is submited in the journal [WIREs Computational Statistics](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19390068).

This study aims to (1) review R packages within the CRAN repository that can fit ordinal regression (OR) models through a Systematic review and (2) compare the specificity and link and model versatility of the packages, among other features.

We found 24 packages with different profiles, being the cumulative logit model the most recurrent model, the ordinal package the most OR specific downloaded package and VGAM the most versatile package.
