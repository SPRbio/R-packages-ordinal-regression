This study aims to (1) review R packages within the CRAN repository that can fit ordinal regression (OR) models through a Systematic review and (2) compare the specificity, fitting characteristics and link and model versatility of the packages, among other features.

We found 48 packages with different profiles, being the cumulative logit model the most recurrent model, the ordinal package the most OR specific downloaded package and VGAM the most versatile package.
